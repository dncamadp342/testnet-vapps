## Project
Name & Category
Project: zkSupplyChain
Category: infrastructure

## Description
zkSupplyChain — Supply chain tracking with zk proofs of authenticity and compliance, no trade secrets exposed.

## SL Integration
- Use zk proofs to verify actions and outcomes.  
- Store lightweight proofs on-chain, keep heavy logic off-chain.  
- Leverage Soundness Layer SDK for validation.  

## Technical Architecture
1. **Frontend**: React/Next.js dApp interface.  
2. **Backend/Game/Engine**: Node.js or Rust with zkSNARKs integration.  
3. **Soundness Layer**: On-chain zk verification and proof registry.  
4. **Smart Contracts**: Core logic (registry, rewards, NFTs, leaderboards depending on project).  

## Timeline
**PoC (2–4 weeks)**  
- Core contract skeleton + SL integration.  
- Basic UI & proof verification prototype.  

**MVP (4–8 weeks)**  
- Full feature set.  
- Community testing.  
- Production-ready UX.  

## Innovation
Unique zk-based approach to infrastructure, ensuring privacy, fairness, and trustless verification.
